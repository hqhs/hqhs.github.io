      <description>Poem by Thomas Moore Lay his sword by his side &amp;ndash; it hath served him too well Not to rest near his pillow below; To the last moment true, from his hand ere it fell, Its point was still turn&amp;rsquo;d to a flying foe. Fellow-labourers in life, let them slumber in death, Side by side, as becomes the reposing brave &amp;ndash; That sword which he loved still unbroke in its sheath, And himself unsubdued in his grave.</description>
