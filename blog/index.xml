      <description>Poem by Thomas Moore Lay his sword by his side &amp;ndash; it hath served him too well Not to rest near his pillow below; To the last moment true, from his hand ere it fell, Its point was still turn&amp;rsquo;d to a flying foe. Fellow-labourers in life, let them slumber in death, Side by side, as becomes the reposing brave &amp;ndash; That sword which he loved still unbroke in its sheath, And himself unsubdued in his grave.</description>

      <description>Optional types in Go Suppose you have a problem: you got relatively small go codebase (10 kloc without tests) to support &amp;amp; develop at your job. You started to add new features, writing tests, deploying it to production on daily basis, and&amp;hellip; It keeps crashing. I&amp;rsquo;m simply dont know every possible problem this codebase has, hence going to talk about only one of them: optional fields done right and wrong, with examples.</description>
