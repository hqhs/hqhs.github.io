		<div class="post-content"><p>Suppose you have a problem: you&rsquo;ve got beautiful opportunity to spent 30 hours
over 3 days with Chris Ricahrdson author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microservices-Patterns-examples-Chris-Richardson/dp/1617294543">microservices patterns</a>, and you need no use this opportunity to ask
one of founding fathers of our current understanding &ldquo;how to make good software&rdquo;.
Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to ask and why. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>This book promotes idea about architectural style that structures an
application as a collection of loosely coupled services
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices">wiki</a>). Basically, instead of
this:</p>

<p>[IMAGE: one giant shitty monolith codebase].</p>

<p>You got this:</p>

<p>[IMAGE: many smaller shitty splitted codebases].</p>

<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of programming patterns with unamaginative acronyms, such as
KISS, DRY, etc., more into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming">competitive programming</a> and <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/193004/what-exactly-is-ctf-and-how-can-i-as-programmer-prepare-for-a-ctf-with-beginner">capture
the flag competitions</a>.
Solving many of the first ones you&rsquo;ll (probably) learn to search for most simple
and fastest solution, doing the second ones you&rsquo;ll (again, probably) learn about
how computers works much more, then N years on you job gives you (I&rsquo;ve not found
suitable N yet, only have 1.5 years of actual working experience), and what&rsquo;s
definetly affect my questions.</p>

<p>Also, I&rsquo;m going to add answers to questions, as I understood them. They&rsquo;re
probably would not be direct quotes, nor addresible to Chris Richardson himself
(although I&rsquo;ll try to ask him to edit my version of his answers if he wants to).
I&rsquo;ll try to provide as much context as possible, but do not take them seriously
in any way possible.</p>

<p>Couple more disclaimers before we talk business. Obviously, there&rsquo;s nothing new
under the sun, and &ldquo;microservice patterns&rdquo; as we call them were discussed in
kernel developers community back in 1970ies [TODO proof link?] as <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Microkernel">&ldquo;microkernel
pattern&rdquo;</a>. And the term &ldquo;microservice&rdquo; was
coined at a software architecture workshop in 2011 (18 page 6th paragrath in
book). My top of the head math definition would be:</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s define your software product as y = f(x) where x &ndash; input and y &ndash; output
in any given format. &ldquo;Microservice&rdquo; means what you split f(x) into smaller
f1..N(x)es and abstract away implementation details behind contracts, (or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">APIs</a>), where
for any given service fi(x) true following statement: fi(x) does not have any
way to access over f1..N(x) state, but only via interface. (I&rsquo;ll talk about such
definition more below). [TODO make better definition &amp; discuss with someone]</p>

<p>The hype around microservices pattern would be main subject of questions, just
because I enjoy separating hype from truth and frequently feel what whose popular
architecture topics are much like <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FWMfQKG3RpZx6irjm/semantic-stopsigns">semantic
stopsigns</a>
and lead to under-optimal solutions.</p>

<p>[TODO: maybe google trends link? microservices/monolith]</p>

<h1 id="question-list">Question list</h1>

<p>Currently I have approximately 10 hours for preparation before actual meetup, I
tried to do my best splitting time between this post and reading actual book,
and may miss some key points. Feel free to correct me any way possible.</p>

<p>Q: TODO: You&rsquo;ll write a lot about suck/rock dichotomy, gartner hype cycle etc. etc.</p>

<p>Q: Do we need microservice architecture from start? Let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re working in
avarage size company (compared to google) and want to build internal tool to
abstract away infrastracture from product developers. How to choose wright way?</p>

<p>Q: Sometimes I have feeling what hype around microservices had competely blown
away it&rsquo;s upsides &amp; downsides. Why does not community talk more about HOW to
make a decision, not about WHICH way is only correct one.</p>

<p>Q: Quote your book: &ldquo;Each technology has drawbacks and limitations that are
often overlooked by its advocates&rdquo;. So, you&rsquo;re microservice advocate. What did
you overlook and what was your mistakes?</p>

<h1 id="the-economy-behind-evangelists">The economy behind evangelists</h1>

<p>Then reading the original book and essaying it I lost count of how many time
Richard say &ldquo;The growing consensus is that if you&rsquo;re building a large, complex
application, you should consider using microservice architecture.&rdquo; or &ldquo;The
disciplined team can slow down the pace of its descent toward monolithic hel &hellip;
the best a team can do is delay the inevitable.&rdquo; in various rephrases.</p>

<h1 id="1-minute-retelling-of-500-page-book">1 minute retelling of 500 page book</h1>

<p>Then you have problems with monnolithic architecture, you eventually must solve
them. One of possible solutions is to refactor monolith into distributed
system. Distributed systems has it&rsquo;s own upsides (faster deploy, modularity from
start etc.) and downsides (increased complexity, tough transition period). One
of key issues to consider is &ldquo;How components of your distributed system would
communicate?&ldquo;. There&rsquo;re many communications patterns available, synchronous one
must be designed to handle partial failures. Also, you should not forget about
changing of testing style then moving from centralized style system to distrubeted.</p>

big ball of mud pattern&rdquo; [2 page 5 paragrath].</p>
